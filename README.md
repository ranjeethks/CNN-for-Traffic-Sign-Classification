# CNN-for-traffic-sign-classification
6 Layer CNN for traffic sign classification

Overview
---

In this project, I use convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify traffic signs. A 6 six layer CNN is trained and validated so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 

Got 98.6% validation accuracy and 96.1% test accuracy (on new images)

A detailed report on what architecture was used and how the CNN was trained is given in [writeup report](https://github.com/ranjeethks/CNN-for-traffic-sign-classification/blob/master/TrafficSignsClassification_Writeup.pdf)
